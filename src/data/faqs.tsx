    question: 'What kind of local ingredients does Nevel use in their beers?',
    answer:
      'Nevel uses a variety of locally grown ingredients to create their beers. Key partners include Foodforest Ketelbroek, where edible trees, shrubs, and herbs are grown using permaculture principles, and Staatsbosbeheer, who grow unsprayed malting barley in Groesbeek and Loenen. Nevel also works with local hop growers like Hop voor Bier and Hogenelst Hop to produce organic hop varieties, as well as old grain varieties such as Heliaro wheat and Red Ebner spelt, grown by Louis Dolmans. The use of local hops, wild yeast, and local grains creates a 100% Gelderland beer.',

    question:
      'Why does Nevel work directly with growers and not use intermediaries?',
    answer:
      'Nevel works directly with growers because they are often pioneers in their field and possess deep knowledge about the taste and application of plants. By visiting the growers personally and avoiding intermediaries, Nevel learns directly from them about the varieties they grow and the subtle nuances of taste. This collaboration helps Nevel craft better beers using the freshest and most unique ingredients.',
